    "The rise of social media and the proliferation of digital news sources have made it easier than ever to spread misinformation and fake news. As a result, this prompts the need to be able to distinguish between real and fake news stories. Machine learning techniques offer a promising solution to this, by allowing us to classify news articles based on their content and other features.\n",

    "In this quest, we explore the use of machine learning classification methods to classify news articles as either real or fake. We will analyse the text of the news articles based on the natural language processing (NLP) methods learnt in previous quests, and evaluate the performance of our classifier using a variety of metrics. \n",
